### Ruby's Ancestor Chain

Always wondered how to see Ruby's class hierarchy? Simply call `ancestors` on a class to see the ancestor chain.

The return array contains the following order:

* the calling class
* its included modules
* its parent class
* the included modules of its parents class
* the parent class of its parent class

Here is the ancestor chain of the String class:

``` ruby
irb> String.ancestors
 => [String, Comparable, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]
```

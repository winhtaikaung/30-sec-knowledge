### Quick Sort

#### Answer

**Merge Sort**: Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves. The merge() function is used for merging two halves. The merge(arr, l, m, r) is a key process that assumes that arr[l..m] and arr[m+1..r] are sorted and merges the two sorted sub-arrays into one. See the following C implementation for details.

#### Partition Algorithm

There can be many ways to do partition, following pseudo code adopts the method given in CLRS book. The logic is simple, we start from the leftmost element and keep track of index of smaller (or equal to) elements as i. While traversing, if we find a smaller element, we swap current element with arr[i]. Otherwise we ignore current element.

#### Pseudo

```Pseudo
MergeSort(arr[], l,  r)
If r > l
     1. Find the middle point to divide the array into two halves:
             middle m = l+ (r-l)/2
     2. Call mergeSort for first half:
             Call mergeSort(arr, l, m)
     3. Call mergeSort for second half:
             Call mergeSort(arr, m+1, r)
     4. Merge the two halves sorted in step 2 and 3:
             Call merge(arr, l, m, r)
```

### Recursive Implementation

```python
# Python program for implementation of MergeSort
def mergeSort(arr):
	if len(arr) > 1:

		# Finding the mid of the array
		mid = len(arr)//2

		# Dividing the array elements
		L = arr[:mid]

		# into 2 halves
		R = arr[mid:]

		# Sorting the first half
		mergeSort(L)

		# Sorting the second half
		mergeSort(R)

		i = j = k = 0

		# Copy data to temp arrays L[] and R[]
		while i < len(L) and j < len(R):
			if L[i] < R[j]:
				arr[k] = L[i]
				i += 1
			else:
				arr[k] = R[j]
				j += 1
			k += 1

		# Checking if any element was left
		while i < len(L):
			arr[k] = L[i]
			i += 1
			k += 1

		while j < len(R):
			arr[k] = R[j]
			j += 1
			k += 1

# Code to print the list


def printList(arr):
	for i in range(len(arr)):
		print(arr[i], end=" ")
	print()


# Driver Code
if __name__ == '__main__':
	arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7]
	print("Given array is", end="\n")
	printList(arr)
	mergeSort(arr)
	print("Sorted array is: ", end="\n")
	printList(arr)

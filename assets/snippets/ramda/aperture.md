### aperture

> ```Number → [a] → [[a]]```

Returns a new list, composed of n-tuples of consecutive elements. If `n` is greater than the length of the list, an empty list is returned.

Acts as a transducer if a transformer is given in list position.

`Example`

```js
R.aperture(2, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); //=> [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5]]
R.aperture(3, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); //=> [[1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5]]
R.aperture(7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); //=> []
```

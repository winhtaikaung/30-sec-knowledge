### lastIndexOf

> ```a → [a] → Number```

Returns the position of the last occurrence of an item in an array, or -1 if the item is not included in the array. `R.equals` is used to determine equality.

`Example`

```js
R.lastIndexOf(3, [-1,3,3,0,1,2,3,4]); //=> 6
R.lastIndexOf(10, [1,2,3,4]);         //=> -1
```

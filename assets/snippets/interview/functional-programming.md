### What is functional programming?

#### Answer

Functional programming is a paradigm in which programs are built in a declarative manner using pure functions that avoid shared state and mutable data. Functions that always return the same value for the same input and don't produce side effects are the pillar of functional programming. Many programmers consider this to be the best approach to software development as it reduces bugs and cognitive load.

#### Good to hear

* Cleaner, more concise development experience

* Features of JavaScript that enable functional programming (`.map`, `.reduce` etc.)
* JavaScript is multi-paradigm programming language (Object-Oriented Programming and Functional Programming live in harmony)

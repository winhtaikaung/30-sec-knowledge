### What is a MIME type and what is it used for?

#### Answer

`MIME` is an acronym for `Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions`. It is used as a standard way of classifying file types over the Internet.

#### Good to hear

* A `MIME type` actually has two parts: a type and a subtype that are separated by a slash (/). For example, the `MIME type` for Microsoft Word files is `application/msword` (i.e., type is application and the subtype is msword).

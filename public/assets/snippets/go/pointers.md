### Pointers

#### Description

Go supports [pointers](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer*programming)>)\*, allowing you to pass references to values and records within your program.

#### Example

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func zeroval(ival int) {
    ival = 0
}

func zeroptr(iptr *int) {
    *iptr = 0
}

func main() {
    i := 1
    fmt.Println("initial:", i)

    zeroval(i)
    fmt.Println("zeroval:", i)

    zeroptr(&i)
    fmt.Println("zeroptr:", i)

    fmt.Println("pointer:", &i)
}
```

#### Explanation

- `zeroval` has an `int` parameter, so arguments will be passed to it by value. `zeroval` will get a copy of ival distinct from the one in the calling function.

- `zeroptr` in contrast has an *int parameter, meaning that it takes an int pointer. The `*iptr` code in the function body then dereferences the pointer from its memory address to the current value at that address. Assigning a value to a dereferenced pointer changes the value at the referenced address.

- The `&i` syntax gives the memory address of i, i.e. a pointer to i.

- zeroval doesnâ€™t change the i in main, but zeroptr does because it has a reference to the memory address for that variable.

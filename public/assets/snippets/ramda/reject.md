### reject

> ```Filterable f => (a → Boolean) → f a → f a```

The complement of filter.

Acts as a transducer if a transformer is given in list position. Filterable objects include plain objects or any object that has a filter method such as `Array`.

`Example`

```js
const isOdd = (n) => n % 2 === 1;

R.reject(isOdd, [1, 2, 3, 4]);              //=> [2, 4]

R.reject(isOdd, {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4});  //=> {b: 2, d: 4}
```

### dissocPath

> ```[Idx] → {k: v} → {k: v}```
> ```Idx = String | Int```

Makes a shallow clone of an object, omitting the property at the given path. Note that this copies and flattens prototype properties onto the new object as well. All non-primitive properties are copied by reference.

`Example`

```js
R.dissocPath(['a', 'b', 'c'], {a: {b: {c: 42}}}); //=> {a: {b: {}}}
```

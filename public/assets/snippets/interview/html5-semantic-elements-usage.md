### Briefly describe the correct usage of the following HTML5 semantic elements: `<header>`, `<article>`,`<section>`, `<footer>`

#### Answer

* `<header>` is used to contain introductory and navigational information about a section of the page. This can include the section heading, the author’s name, time and date of publication, table of contents, or other navigational information.

* `<article>` is meant to house a self-contained composition that can logically be independently recreated outside of the page without losing its meaning. Individual blog posts or news stories are good examples.

* `<section>` is a flexible container for holding content that shares a common informational theme or purpose.

* `<footer>` is used to hold information that should appear at the end of a section of content and contain additional information about the section. Author’s name, copyright information, and related links are typical examples of such content.

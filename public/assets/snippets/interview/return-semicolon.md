### What does the following function return?

```js
function greet() {
  return
  {
    message: "hello"
  }
}
```

#### Answer

Because of JavaScript's automatic semicolon insertion (ASI), the compiler places a semicolon after the `return` keyword and therefore it returns `undefined` without an error being thrown.

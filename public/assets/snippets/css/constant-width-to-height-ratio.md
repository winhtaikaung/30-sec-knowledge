### Constant width to height ratio

Given an element of variable width, it will ensure its height remains proportionate in a responsive fashion
(i.e., its width to height ratio remains constant).

#### HTML

```html
<div class="constant-width-to-height-ratio"></div>
```

#### CSS

```css
.constant-width-to-height-ratio {
  background: #333;
  width: 50%;
}
.constant-width-to-height-ratio::before {
  content: '';
  padding-top: 100%;
  float: left;
}
.constant-width-to-height-ratio::after {
  content: '';
  display: block;
  clear: both;
}
```

#### Demo

#### Explanation

`padding-top` on the `::before` pseudo-element causes the height of the element to equal a percentage of
its width. `100%` therefore means the element's height will always be `100%` of the width, creating a responsive
square.

This method also allows content to be placed inside the element normally.

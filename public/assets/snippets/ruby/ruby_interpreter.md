### What is a Ruby Interpreter?

A Ruby interpreter is any program that parses the Ruby source code to imitate its behavioral execution. It converts the program line by line compared to a compiler which converts the whole program at once. Hence, a code change only requires an edit. Interpreters only throw an error if the program gets executed and reach the line that containes the error, whereas compilers will throw the error already before execution.
There are multiple versions of Ruby interpreters to choose from, each with a different but very similar set of rules and options.

Common Ruby Interpreters:

* Ruby MRI
* JRuby
* YARV
* Rubinius
